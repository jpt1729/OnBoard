# UV Water Purifier (Trail)

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is supposed to serve as a lid to a water bottle. This lid will shine UVC light into the water which can help kill viruses and harmful bacteria. Our work is meant for the Trail!
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I began figuring out the specifics of what I would need (i.e. lights, battery). At first I was hoping for a simple 2 sided design but after learning it would be really expensive I decided on designing the case well so that I could build this.
